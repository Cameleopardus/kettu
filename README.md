# kettu

Port of http://github.com/kjg/derailleur and the original Transmission Web Client  
using [jquery](http://jquery.com), [sammy](http://github.com/quirkey/sammy), [jspec](http://github.com/visionmedia/jspec) and [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js).

## Thanks 
* kjg for all the work on the transmission web client.
* lenalena for introducing proper jspec testing to this project.

## Where to use?
You can use kettu instead of the original web client to remotely administrate your transmission application.

## Usage
Once you allowed remote access in your transmission client, you can simply open the `index.html` in the browser. If you run your transmission application on something other than the default host and port, you can adjust these settings in the `rpc` file.
